# StringDraw
Original idea by Petros Vrellis.
Program that approximates an image by drawing a number of lines that start and end on the oval border + GUI.
Work in progress.

To test out, download the .java executable or copile the code. In the app select File -> Open File and select an image of your choice. Wait untile the image is loaded and click 'Run'. Experiment with parameters. 
You can also select Settings -> Select Mode -> Optimization Mode to generate two pictures independently in order to compare how different parameters affect the result.
